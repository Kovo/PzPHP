PzPHP
======
PzPHP is powerful, lightweight, and flexible framework.

PzPHP allows developers to easily extend its functionality to suit the needs of their projects.

PzPHP is not meant to be a direct substitute for larger frameworks like CakePHP, Symfony, and Zend. Instead, it is built for developers who value performance and ease of use, over bulk, and strict constraints that come with larger frameworks.
