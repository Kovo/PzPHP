PzPHP
======
PzPHP is powerful, lightweight, and flexible framework.

PzPHP leverages the tools and methods found inside its library, allowing developers to easily extend functionality to suit the needs of their projects.

PzPHP is not meant to be a direct substitute for larger frameworks like CakePHP, Symfony, Zend, etc... Instead, it is built for developers who value performance and ease of use, over bulk, and strict constraints that come with larger frameworks.
