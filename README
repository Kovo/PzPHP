PzPHP
======
PzPHP is powerful, lightweight, and flexible framework. It is built around and powered by the Pz library.

PzPHP leverages the tools and methods in the Pz library, allowing developers to easily extend functionality to suit the needs of their projects.

PzPHP is not meant to be a direct substitute for larger frameworks like CakePHP, Symfony, Zend, etc... Instead, it is built for developers who value performance and ease of use, over robustness, bulk, and strict constraints that come with larger frameworks.
